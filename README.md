# Project-14---Grocery-Bud

Grocery Bud is a simple grocery list management CRUD app.

You can add as many grocery items as you want.
You can edit an individual grocery item depending on your preference
You can delete an individual grocery item depending on your preference 
You can clear an entire list and start over again.

The app has several alerts which contain different messages related to the action a user is taking.

If a user clicks on the Submit button without adding a grocery item, it displays an alert message saying, 'Please enter a grocery item'
When a user adds a grocery item to the list, it displays an alert message saying, 'Item added to list'
When a user clears the entire list, it displays an alert message saying, 'List cleared'
